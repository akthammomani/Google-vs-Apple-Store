# Google vs Apple_Store: 

![header_PT_0803_The-Differences-Google-Play-vs-Apple’s-App-Store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67468718/103197528-0a028480-489b-11eb-9892-681d69c351c8.jpg)

A company that designs operating systems, wants to build a major apps store into their user interface. To this end, they want to know whether Google Play
apps have higher reviews on average than Apple Store apps (or vice versa) , as they’re intending to strike a deal with just one of these companies. 

To complete this project, we’ll work through a series of steps known as the Data Science Pipeline, or DSP. The DSP is a general and fairly broad sequence of steps data
scientists use to tackle and solve business problems. While working on this project,

We’ll complete each step of the DSP, including:
 1. Sourcing and loading data
 2. Cleaning and transforming data
 3. Visualizing and modeling data
 4. Evaluating, presenting findings, and concluding our work.
